# Password Generator Starter Code
For this module I was unable to complete all of the objective criteria, and ran into issues with my prompts not popping up after I respaced the javascript code. However, I can describe what I did in order to meet criteria. 

First, I defined all of my variables, which in this project are the character types. I then ensured that when the button was clicked on, it would start a function which could return a random but defined/customized string of characters. I did this by prompting the user to input there length, as well as by answering 'yes' to a series of prompts about the other characters. If the user responded with anything other than yes, then the password generated would remain the same. I stored these responses under new variables with the additional term "input" attached. 

At the culimination of these prompts, where the user has decided the password length and whether or not it includes uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers, I included a for and then ensured that the password generated would be from a random selection of previously included and defined characters. I then wrote the password for the #password input so that it could be outputted when the generatePassword function ran.
